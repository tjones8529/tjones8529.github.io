I did this project as part of a 3 man team in Vanderbilt University's Engineering Management program. This document focuses on the potential of hydrogen fuel cell semi-trucks in the trucking industry and the obstacles to consider using data-driven analysis and understanding. The strategy covers 12 main issues including the current competitive market, market demand/cost, intellectual property, commercialization, etc.
