# Goal

Speed climbing is the newest discipline of competitive climbing and involves racing up a standardized 15 meter wall as fast as possible. My goal is to hit a sub 7 second time and become one of the top collegiate speed climbers in the nation.

# Current Progress
My current fastest time is 8.53 seconds, which put me at 9th in the nation for collegiate last year. Most climbers start off not even able to reach the top of the wall, and a 15 second time is considered average amongst high-level climbers. My experience in other disciplines of climbing has given me an advantage in making this goal possible in a reasonable amount of time.
