I created this project as part of a 3 man team in Vanderbilt University's Engineering Management program. This document focuses on the potential of hydrogen fuel cell semi-trucks in the trucking industry and uses  data-driven analysis to undstand obstacles to consider. The strategy covers 12 main issues a new company would face entering the hydrogen fuel industry including the current competitive market, market demand/cost, intellectual property, commercialization, etc.
